I've done a lot of things in my life - Stanford Professor (well actually the Acting Assistant variety), corporate hack, Tech company founder, Thunderbird email project leader, taught computer science in prisons, even tried doing business for a few years in Azerbaijan because I wanted to experience corruption first-hand. (Maybe that wasn't the smartest thing to do).

Now though I don't really want a real job, I just want to play with my tech toys. So for the past couple of years I've built myself a small research robot called BDBD, and tried different softwares on it. Decided I needed to learn ROS, and got the thing moving around and avoiding the stairway ledge, conversing, and recognizing family members. BDBD is currently written in ROS1, but I'm ready to move to ROS2.

I'm still learning a lot as I dabble in ROS. As I am learning different things, particularly if the discovery process was less
than obvious, I thought it might be useful to others to document what I learn in a way that could be accessible to others.

So that's what this is about - documenting things I learn to do while converting to ROS2, and generally dabbling in ROS.
