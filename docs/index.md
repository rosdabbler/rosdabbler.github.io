I'm someone who dabbles in robots, specifically using the Robot Operating System. These posts are my attempts to convey things I have learned in a way that I hope may make the learning paths of others shorter.

I am not running robots professionally, so I make no guarantees that these thoughts will work in your environment.

Here's my research robot, a heavily modified Waveshare Jetbot, with added:
- Realspeaker directional microphone and speaker.
- Intel Realsense SR305 depth camera, with T265 tracking camera.
- Upgraded motors and power.
- Pan/tilt Pi camera
