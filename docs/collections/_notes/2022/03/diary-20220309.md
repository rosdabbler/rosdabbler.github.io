I have the camera working locally. Now I want to get the existing work (that had been done in Docker) working locally.

## Dependencies

I have not been following ROS2 practices for dependencies. Can I start to do that?

I have both pip and apt dependencies. How to express those? Somewhere I recall a list of possible supported dependencies. Where was that? https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/base.yaml

I had to split non-ROS2 dependencies into a separate install script.

PanTilt now works. googleTTS runs but produces not sound. I need to configure audio in this new OS instance.

It was simple, just adding asound.conf seemed to do it.

2022-03-28

I put BDBD back together, now sound playback is not working. The basic test is this:
```bash
aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
```
That runs, but no sound comes out. This may be a permission problem, because this works:
```bash
sudo aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
```
though it also complains about 'Home directory not accessible: Permission denied'
```

but it I do ```su``` followed by the command, still works but bo error. So it seems to be a permission problem.


Looking at seeedstudio webpage I got a hint of how to specify devices. With that hint, this works:

```bash
 aplay -D plughw:2,0 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
 ```
 meaning that it may not be a permission issue, but a config issue.

 With -v I get more details:

So somehow I am using pulse audio, and that is not working.

I restarted nano, checked:
```bash
systemctl --user status pulseaudio
```
and it is not running. If I start it, then aplay works.

I did:
```bash
systemctl --user enable pulseaudio
```
and rebooted. pulseaudio is now restarted - but sound is not working.

I found info on how to set default device for pulseaudio. So I created a file /home/kent/.config/pulse with this content:
```
.include /etc/pulse/default.pa
set-default-sink alsa_output.usb-SEEED_ReSpeaker_4_Mic_Array__UAC1.0_-00.analog-stereo
```
After ```systemctl --user restart pulseaudio``` then ```speaker-test``` worked. I'm going to try with a cold boot. ... Worked.

But what does not work now is arecord. I need to do the same thing there.

2022-03-29

```bash
pacmd list-sources

4 source(s) available.
    index: 0
	name: <alsa_output.usb-SEEED_ReSpeaker_4_Mic_Array__UAC1.0_-00.analog-stereo.monitor>
...
```
so I assume I need:
```
set-default-source alsa_output.usb-SEEED_ReSpeaker_4_Mic_Array__UAC1.0_-00.analog-stereo.monitor
```
Added this to /home/kent/.config/pulse/default.pa, did ```systemctl --user restart pulseaudio``` then ```~/github/rkent/bdbd2_jl_ws/src/bdbd2/bdbd2_jetbot/scripts/atest.sh``` Did not work.

I can make the recording work using ```arecord -v -D plughw:2,0 -d 5 -f s32_LE -r 16000 /tmp/test.wav``` so the issue is specifying the default.

I also tried in default.pa "set-default-source alsa_output.usb-SEEED_ReSpeaker_4_Mic_Array__UAC1.0_-00.analog-stereo.monitoralsa_input.usb-SEEED_ReSpeaker_4_Mic_Array__UAC1.0_-00.multichannel-input" but that also did not work.

Before I give up, I'm going to install the old OS and see how it works. Previous reinstall (bdbd2) speaker-test did not work, and atest.sh did not exist.

### Summary of sound setup:
1)  Make sure pulseaudio starts
2)  Configure default pulseaudio source

In bdbd, we use aplay to default device for playback. Recording searches for the device, so default arecord is not needed. I can't get arecord to work, so I deleted its test from atest.sh
